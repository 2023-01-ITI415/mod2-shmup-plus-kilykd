For this addition to the space shooter game I wanted to add some sort of win condition that made the gameplay finite, instead of keeping the gameplay infinite and adding some sort of scoring system. My approach to making this game have a win condition was by adding a boss battle, and if they player is able to defeat the boss then they win and the game restarts.
	 For the boss I took the enemy4 prefab and made it larger, and then limited its movement to the top of the screen. It also shoots projectiles back at the player that each remove 1 shield level. I gave the boss a LOT of health because not only did I want it to be difficult, but I wanted to encourage players to use the mechanic of having multiple of the same weapon. Because of this, the boss will not spawn until a certain number of normal enemies have, giving the player time to collect some shields and more weapons. I also wanted the spread shot to feel more like a special weapon, so I gave it a lower chance to spawn, but also increased the damage that it does. If you are able to collect multiple spread power ups, you can do massive damage to the boss. Lastly, the boss has a health bar to let the player know how much health the boss has left.
